Tasks to still accomplish:
-Incorrect and Correct highlighting -- check
-Broken submit on coding problems.
-Recently Correct function isn't working
-Local Storage functions for stats
-db storage for stats -- check!

Looking down the pipeline:
-Oauth with Google and Github so you can log in and save your recently correct and your stats
-Build my own python compiler
-More fill in the blank questions

Basic wireframe:

coding questions
take a test:
-- two random harder questions, a few quiz questions, maybe a progress bar or a timer?

available answers
notes:
recently correct questions should filter out and not be repeated _by time_
add many more questions, including fill-in-the-blanks

      coding questions:
        question
        coding block
        console output
      statistics component:
        correct, incorrect, clear stats buttons


       future test page
          test:
            random collection of harder questions
            timer
            progress bar
            forward and back buttons?
