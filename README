Tasks to still accomplish:
-Incorrect and Correct highlighting -- check
-Broken submit on coding problems.
-Recently Correct function isn't working
-Local Storage functions for stats
-db storage for stats -- check!

Looking down the pipeline:
-Oauth with Google and Github so you can log in and save your recently correct and your stats
-Build my own python compiler
-More fill in the blank questions
